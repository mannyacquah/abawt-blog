  Hey there! Welcome to ABAWT! :)
</p>

How about making Africa even more awesome? Huh? How about that?!

How about getting together as a team of like-minded, determined and focussed individuals who would love to contribute to the welfare of Africa through technology. 

We've got the skill-set. We might already have the passion or might lack it a bit. 
All we need now is a common ground where we can all put our heads together, brainstorm and fuel as well as channel our innovative ideas into making Africa even better. 

Obviously over a few beers and the occasional pizza if the sponsors are feeling generous ;). 
And once a month should be really productive. 

So this group is for anyone from all walks of life out there who would love Africa to be seen in a different light in regards to technology and be proud to be instrumental in making this change happen.

Come on over and join us here [Meetup Group](http://www.meetup.com/A-Better-Africa-With-Tech-ABAWT-Meetup) :)
